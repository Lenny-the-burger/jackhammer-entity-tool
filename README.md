First of maybe several? JHammer addons.

This is the source code for the JHammer entity editor. Aims to give you full control
    over entities in game and recreate the hammer entity tool.

If there are any issues or bugs with this, please make an issue on the github repo.
    Commenting on the steam workshop page is fine but github is preferred.

JHammer is a series of addons that aims to give people hammer-like abilities in game. 
    It is a work in progress and is not yet complete.

Feel free to use my code for anything you want, but for commercial use, please contact me first.
