# JHammer entity editor
A GMOD addon for editing entities in-game. The editor requires some advanced knolege of the source engine, but is heavily documented so anyone with enough ambition can easily learn how to use it.

With this addon you can:
- Edit entities in-game to create crazy things.
- Test new entity set ups without having to recompile the map.
- Prototype [I/O ineractions](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Inputs_and_Outputs) for maps/mods.
- Test out entites that you dont know that well in-game, again skipping the neeed to recompile the map.

This addon lets you have total control over entities in your game, and is a powerful tool for creating new maps. This addon aims to give you the full power of the hammer entity editor, but completly in-game.

## Jackhammer (JHammer)

Jackhammer is a set of GMOD addons that aims to give people the full power of the hammer editor but in game. This is the first addon in the series and is a work in progress.
I do not know if more addons will be made in the series, as I have other plans once I finish this.

## Features

The entity editor has some limitations, but also adds some features:
- The editor is fully in-game, no map recompile or game restart required. (Some ents may not work though :( thx source)
- View invisible point entites with hammer sprites rendered in-game.
- Aspects that are added to entities by the engine or GMOD are also modifiable.

Limitations:
- There is currently no way to find out what I/O links existing entities have. This may be possible, but I am limited by the GMOD lua library here.
- There is currently no way to export/save entities to hammer. You will have to recreate them manually.

## Installation

The best way to install is to do it from the GMOD workshop. This tool was designed for single player, I do not know how well it will work on servers. I also provide the GMA file in the github releases if you want it fomr there for some reason. **[Workshop link coming soon]**

## Source code usage

You are free to modify and copy this code as long as you give proper credit. If you are intrested in something like this being made for your game/mod, please contact me, steam messages or my discord: Lenny the burger#3575 work fine.

If you would like to contribute code all I can really tell you is that you can make it better, a lot of this was written while I was sleep deprived and thinking of something else.
